# Automatic Product Extraction, Classification, and Analysis of Receipt Data
This repository stores code, models, research, and experimentation conducted for my final year project.

A proposed pipeline to extract information from receipts and classify the products into relevant categories.

Also included is a novel dataset containing receipts collected over a period of months to reflect a normal consumer's common purchases.

This project was written in python using Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab.

Please see "Receipt Processor.pdf" and "dissertation.pdf" for research and further information.
